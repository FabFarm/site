	                                <p> <h3> Introduction :</h3></p>

									<p>For this week group assignment we must to Rewiew the Medical Safety Datasheet about the materials used for mould and cast a test and learn tips and things about mill process which are important to consider before design a moul more complicated such as a mould in 2, 3 or 4 parts.</p>

									<p>First we made was learn about the differents silicons founded at the market. The last year Pilu made this assignment buying the silicon present in CEU Fablab so this year was an opportunity for learn more about other kinds or brands. </p>

									<p> Our remote instructor recommended to us buy at this website : <a href="http://formx.es/" class=""><b>Form.es</b></a> because they deliver fast so there we was taking a look.</p>

									<p>Finally, we decided to buy the Silicon Rubber Platinum Cure 3030 Slide from <b>smooth-on</b> brand so we went to their site for learn more about this product.There we founded the datasheet for dowload and read it before to start.  </p> 

									<p> So here is the <b>Technical Datasheet</b> : </p>

<p> There we found usefull pages with technnical information about every materials they are developing : </p>

<p><h2> 1st EXERCISE</h2></p>

<center><p><b> SUMARIZE THE TECHNICAL DATA SHEET FOR LEARN ABOUT THE MATERIALS : </p></center></b>

<li> 3030 SLIDE® is a platinum cure silicone rubber that offers greatly reduced surface tension. 
<li> Mix ratio is 1:1 by weight or volume. 
<li> Pot life is 45 minutes and cures in about 16 hours to Shore 00-30. 
<li> Silicone surface must be exposed to air for 24 hours to bring out slide effect.

<p> About the cure process is important to notice that : </p>
<li> 3030 SLIDE : Is White Translucent.
<li> Silicon wiil Yellow (We can to add pigments colors to the rubber before mix together.
<li> Is soft, strong and stretchy (not distortion after several strectching).

<p>MEASURING & MIXING</p>
<li> Before begin, pre-mix Part B thoroughly. After dispensing required amounts of Parts A and B into mixing container (1A:1B by volume or weight),
mix thoroughly for 3 minutes making sure that you scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing container several times. </p>
<li>After mixing parts A and B, vacuum degassing is recommended to eliminate any entrapped air. </p>

<p>POURING, CURING & MATERIAL PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>For best results, pour your mixture in a single spot at the lowest point of the mold. Let the rubber seek its level. A uniform flow will help minimize entrapped air.</p>
<li>Curing - Allow rubber to cure as prescribed at room temperature (73°F/23°C) before demolding. Do not cure rubber where temperature is less than 65°F/18°C.</p>
Material Performance & Storage - The physical life of a cured silicone piece depends on how we use it but in general have a long life.</p>


<p><h2> 2nd EXERCISE</h2></p>

<center><p><b> READ THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET FOR LEARN ABOUT THE MATERIALS : </p></center></b>

<p> The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for this or any Smooth-On product should be read prior to use and is available upon request from SmoothOn so we was researching and finally we founded some. This one about ECOFLEX series :  </p>

<p><center><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.smooth-on.com/msds/files/Ecoflex_Series.pdf" frameborder="0" allowvr allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" onmousewheel=""></iframe></center></p>

<p> And this one about differents kind of silicone between them the SLIDE 3030 : 
<p><center><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.smooth-on.com/msds/files/BD_DS_Eco_Equ_EZB_EZS_Psy_MS_OOMOO_Reb_ST_SS_Soma_Sol_Sorta.pdf" frameborder="0" allowvr allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" onmousewheel=""></iframe></center></p>

<p> We read both for review them.</p>

<p><h2> 3rd EXERCISE</h2></p>

<center><p><b> REVIEW THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET FOR LEARN ABOUT THE MATERIALS : </p></center></b>

<p><b>1.</b> Classification of the substance or mixture : Not a hazardous substance or mixture according to United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200), the Canadian Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) and Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and subsequent amendments.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> First Aid Measures : </p>

<li> Inhalation: Remove source(s) of contamination and move victim to fresh air. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration, then oxygen if needed. Contact physician immediately. </p>
<li> Eye Contact: Flush eyes with plenty of water. If irritation persists, seek medical attention.</p>
<li> Skin Contact: In case of skin contact, wash thoroughly with soap and water.
<li>Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting unless instructed by a physician.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Fire-Fighting Measures :</p>
<li> Extinguishing Media : Water Fog, Dry Chemical, and Carbon Dioxide Foam</p>
<li> Advice for firefighters: Use water spray to cool fire-exposed surfaces and to protect the people. </p>

<p><b>4.</b>Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Only properly protected personnel should remain in the spill area; dike and contain spill.</p>

<li> Environmental precautions: No special environmental precautions required but they reccomend methods and material for containment and cleaning up absorb or scrape up excess into suitable container for disposal and wash the area with dilute ammonia solution.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Conditions for safe storage :  Keep container(s) tightly closed and properly labeled. Store in cool, dry, well ventilated place away from heat, direct sunlight, strong oxidizers and any incompatibles. </p>

<p>Store in approved containers and protect against physical damage.</p>
<p> Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed to prevent leakage.</p>
<p> Empty containers retain residue and may be dangerous. 
<p>Avoid water contamination.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Toxicological Information : In this section we didn´t find nothing about skin corrosion, reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity or chronic exposure.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Ecological Information : No datas about toxicity, degradability, persistenceor mobility in soil.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Stability and Reactivity : We found important the thermal oxidative decomposition because can to produce carbon oxides, gasses or vapors.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Protection Equipment : </p>

<li> Hands : Gloves, neoprene, rubber or PVC.
<li> Respiratory : A mask approved equipped with organic vapor cartridges.
<li> Eyes : Safety Glassses

<p><b> 10.</b> NEVER : </p>
<li>Eat, drink or smoke in work areas. </p>
<li>Children should not use this product without adult supervision.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> ALLERGEN : People who are allergic to durian, tree nuts and tree nut derivatives or musk thistle seed should avoid contact with this product.</p>
